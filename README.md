## Project Overview
As part of Global Electronics' data analytics team, this project aims to conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on various datasets to uncover valuable insights. The goal is to provide actionable recommendations that can enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and drive overall business growth.

## Business Use Cases
The analysis seeks to uncover insights across customer demographics, product sales, and store operations that will:
- Enhance marketing strategies.
- Optimize inventory management.
- Improve sales forecasting.
- Inform pricing strategies based on currency fluctuations.
- Guide product development and store expansion decisions.

## Project Approach
The analysis follows a structured approach:
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Handling missing values, data type conversions, and dataset merging.
2. **SQL Database Loading**: Inserting cleaned data into an SQL database.
3. **Power BI Visualization**: Creating interactive dashboards to visualize insights.
4. **SQL Query Development**: Writing SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.

## Data Sources
The datasets provided by Global Electronics contain information on:
- **Customers**: Demographics and purchase history.
- **Products**: Product details and sales performance.
- **Sales**: Transactional data, including quantity and price.
- **Stores**: Store locations and operational data.
- **Currency Exchange Rates**: Conversion rates for international transactions.

## SQL Queries
Ten SQL queries were developed to answer key business questions, such as:
1. Customer demographics and purchase behaviors.
2. Product popularity and profitability.
3. Store sales performance.
4. Impact of currency on sales.

## Analysis Steps
The analysis was conducted in the following steps:
1. **Customer Analysis**:
   - Analyze demographic distribution by gender, age, and location.
   - Examine purchase patterns, including average order value and frequency.
   - Segment customers based on demographics and purchasing behaviors.

2. **Sales Analysis**:
   - Assess overall sales trends and seasonality.
   - Identify top-performing products by sales and revenue.
   - Evaluate store performance and currency impact on sales.

3. **Product Analysis**:
   - Determine the most and least popular products.
   - Calculate profit margins to evaluate product profitability.
   - Analyze category and subcategory performance.

4. **Store Analysis**:
   - Review store performance metrics, including sales and operational data.
   - Conduct a geographical analysis to identify high-performing regions.

## Results and Recommendations
Upon completing the analysis, the following recommendations were made to improve business outcomes:
- **Marketing Strategies**: Target specific customer segments based on demographics and purchasing behaviors.
- **Inventory Management**: Adjust stock levels based on product popularity and sales trends.
- **Sales Forecasting**: Identify seasonal trends to predict sales volumes and prepare inventory.
- **Store Expansion**: Recommend locations for expansion based on geographical sales analysis.
- **Pricing Strategy**: Adjust international pricing to align with currency exchange rate impacts.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **SQL**: Data storage and query execution.
- **Power BI/Tableau**: Interactive data visualizations.

## Visualizations
Interactive visualizations were created in Power BI/Tableau to showcase the insights obtained from the analysis, including:
- Customer demographics and purchase patterns.
- Product and store performance.
- Regional sales distribution and currency impact on sales.
